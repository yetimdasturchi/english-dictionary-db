        "definition": "A Burman measure of twelve miles.\n   V () V, the twenty-second letter of the English alphabet, is a vocal\n   consonant. V and U are only varieties of the same character, U being\n   the cursive form, while V is better adapted for engraving, as in stone.\n   The two letters were formerly used indiscriminately, and till a\n   comparatively recent date words containing them were often classed\n   together in dictionaries and other books of reference (see U). The\n   letter V is from the Latin alphabet, where it was used both as a\n   consonant (about like English w) and as a vowel. The Latin derives it\n   from it from a form (V) of the Greek vowel \/ (see Y), this Greek letter\n   being either from the same Semitic letter as the digamma F (see F), or\n   else added by the Greeks to the alphabet which they took from the\n   Semitic. Etymologically v is most nearly related to u, w, f, b, p; as\n   in vine, wine; avoirdupois, habit, have; safe, save; trover,\n   troubadour, trope. See U, F, etc."
